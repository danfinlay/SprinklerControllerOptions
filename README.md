# Smart Sprinkler Options

Maybe it was when [Google bought Nest for $3.2
billion](http://www.wired.com/2014/01/googles-3-billion-nest-buy-finally-make-internet-things-real-us/),
but it seems like sizable efforts are finally reaching the Smart
Irrigation field.

To help make sense of the options that are here and coming soon, I'm
starting this git, so that others can contribute the work as well.


## Web Enabled Sprinkler Controllers

[bluespray](http://www.bluespray.net/): *ON BACK ORDER* One of the earliest to have a
nice mobile experience as well as weather lookups online.  Not the
prettiest, but mostly marketed to landscapers.  $229 (8 zones)/ $279 (16
zones).

[cyber-rain](https://www.cyber-rain.com/):  It's ugly, listing for
completion.

[rachio](https://www.rach.io/): *TAKING PRE-ORDERS FOR MAY*  Looks cool, preorder in May for $249 (8
zone) or $299 (16 zone).

*KICKSTARTER, UNSHIPPED*  


## Sensor Based Sprinkler Controllers

[plantlink](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1387729422/plant-link-listen-to-your-plants): Uses electroconductivity to measure soil moisture. $149 for 3 sensors and the valve controller (maybe only 1 zone?)

[Fliwer](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fliwer/fliwer-plant-and-play?ref=live):
Uses sensors for light, humidity, temperature, soil moisture, and
electroconductivity to measure fertilizer.  Requires fliwer hub to
connect to internet, each fliwer is a sensor and single zone controller.
Final price unclear.
